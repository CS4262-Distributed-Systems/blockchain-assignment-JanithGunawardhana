# Blockchain Concepts

1. Distributed Ledger

A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared (shared by mutual consent without an act of writing) and synchronized across many geographical locations. Any participant at each node of this shared network has access to the recordings shared across the network and can possess an identical copy of them. Further, in a couple of seconds or minutes, any modifications or additions to the ledger are reflected and replicated to all participants. The deployment of a distributed ledger eliminates the need for a central authority to keep a check on manipulation. Further, the usage of distributed ledgers reduces cyber threats and financial fraud.

2. Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are essentially programs that are stored in Blockchains which run when certain criteria are satisfied based on predetermined conditions.They're usually used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all parties can be notified about the conclusion right away, without the need for any intermediaries or time waste. They also can be used to automate a workflow, starting the following step when certain circumstances are satisfied.
